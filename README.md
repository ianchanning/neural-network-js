# A ~~Neural Network~~ Perceptron from scratch in JavaScript

[![Screenshot](neural-network-screenshot.png)](neural-network-screenshot.png)

## The plan

We're going to train a single neuron (perceptron) to linearly separate some 2D points.

1. Generate some data
1. Visualise the data
1. Label some data
1. Initialise the neuron with random weights
1. Use the labelled data to train the neuron

All done in pure JavaScript, from scratch with no libraries

## Quickstart

1. Download [master.zip][1]
1. Extract the zip
1. Open the `neural-network-js-master` directory
1. Open `index.html`

That should open in a browser with a page that looks like the above screenshot.

Then follow the [tutorial][2].
